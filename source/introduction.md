## Welcome to Stockic API! 

Stockic is a **minimal and intelligent** finance newsfeed application without noise for Android and iOS. We gather news from various trusted sources, compile their insights with AI, and feed it to you so you don't have to wander around different platforms. This **enhances your productivity** and keeps you updated with current finance news. All the content would be untouched, and everything would move through AI to prevent any external human interpretation of news so that you can get exact insights in short forms.     

**Pain points** of finance professionals we tackle:
1. The pain of going through useless fluff of information
2. The pain of manually distilling the right impactful information 
3. The pain of organizing all the information they have collected
4. The pain of missing out on the right opportunity when they could have acted if they had the right information

So, with thorough analysis, we decided on the features that make **Stockic the last newsfeed app our users will download**:
1. _Summarizing news content in a way that we only pull the parts that can have a real impact on financial markets._
2. _Even further distilling numerical and impactful parts of the news._
3. _We tag the news with companies and topics with visible impacts and allow users to filter based on their interests so users don't waste brain power on irrelevant topics._ 
4. _In addition to being rich in numerical data, our metrics are paired with relevant news, which can impact those metrics so that users can make their own decisions right in place._
5. _Integrations like Notion and Obsidian allows users to push relevant content into their workspaces and use it to analyze later (or do whatever they want to operate on the data)._
6. _Supporting Google Calendars to mark important dates like IPO releases, launches, etc._
7. _Stockic AI for answering all the questions users are wondering based on today's news._

This app is designed to serve users in broad categories, **from casual investors to multi-billion dollar fund managers, from financial institution students to business analysts**. 

**We are actively looking for funding.** If you are interested, reach out!:
